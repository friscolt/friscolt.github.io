## My personal site!

This repository is used to host my personal site [my personal site](https://friscolt.github.io), where you can find general information about my work, a brief CV, 
my research progress and some important news.

The base theme of the personal site is [minimal theme](https://pages-themes.github.io/minimal/), which is available on the github pages. One of the personal pages used as inspiration is the site of  [Shuangning Li](https://lsn235711.github.io/index.html). 

If you want to use this same style, you can clone the repository and edit it.
