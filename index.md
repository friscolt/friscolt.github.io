### About me

I'm a **PhD student** at the **Department of Computer Sciences** at <a href="https://tec.mx/es" target="_blank">*Tecnológico de Monterrey</a> 🇲🇽 and <a href="https://www.univ-lorraine.fr" target="_blank">**Université de Lorraine</a> 🇫🇷

Currently, I'm working in kidney stone classification in endoscopic images at the [CV-INSIDE Lab](https://www.researchgate.net/lab/CV-INSIDE-Computer-Vision-for-Image-aNalysiS-bIomeDical-Engineering-Gilberto-Ochoa-Ruiz) under the direction of [*Gilberto Ochoa-Ruiz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DDtiliwAAAAJ&hl=en) and [**Christian Daul](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=XPH6u74AAAAJ&hl=fr)



Most importantly, **I'm always on the lookout for a great <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affogato" target="_blank">affogato!</a>**

### Research interests

My interests are in **medical image analysis**, **computer vision**,  and **machine learning**. This involves multidisciplinary research from computing and biomedical sciences. 

  
I'm now working on some interesting **projects**:

*  [Classification of **kidney stones** in endoscopic images](/kidneystones) 📌
*  [Visualization and localization of **blood vessels** in speckle images](/bloodvessels)
*  [Breast classification on **mammography** images](/mammography) 
*  [Visualization and analysis of **colony growth** in speckle images](/colonygrowth) 


If you want to discuss things of images, or **make a collaboration**, send me an [email](mailto:franciscolt@tec.mx?subject=%20Hello,%20Francisco)  or follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/Friscolt" target="_blank">twitter</a>.


Cheers,
Francisco 🇲🇽

### Updates

* July 16, 2025: Happy to attend the Conference on Medical Image Understanding and Analysis (MIUA) in Leeds, UK 🇬🇧. This year, we are presenting our paper [“Assessing the Generalization Performance of SAM for Ureteroscopy Scene Segmentation and Understanding”](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-98691-8_18), co-authored with my student Martin Villagrana (TEC,CV-INSIDE).
