### Statement

I thank [Dr. Gilberto Ochoa-Ruiz](https://gda.itesm.mx/faculty/en/professors/gilberto-ochoa-ruiz) for integrating me into the **kidney stones team**. Also, as soon as I have authorization and the work is published, I will report the **codes** of the methods used.

 I am currently working on increasing the size of the datasets in patches for **classification**, extracting **features**, balancing classes, and classifying with **machine learning** methods such as **xgboost**.

### Research

At the moment, I have a conference paper and a journal paper with the **kidney stones team**

* **On the in vivo recognition of kidney stones using machine learning** at the journal of [*Artificial Intelligence In Medicine*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/artificial-intelligence-in-medicine*) (Submitted Aug 2021)

* [**Assessing  deep  learning methods  for  the  identification of kidney  stones in endoscopic images**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01146) at the *43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC).*
